# Learning-AI with tensorflow

This project is created in order for people to learn AI in a organized manner and as easy as possible.
The library to be used would be **tensorflow.js** as stated in the header, since it's easy to access and could be build literally anywhere.
The idea is like making a syllabus for people that's interested and planning to learn AI.

There should be a 'theory' folder explaining at least basics and another folder for all experimental tiny projects with AI.
Everyone is welcome to open new issue and idea of what to build next.
This will serve as a library too for people finding reference on how to build certain simple web AI.
